# Getting Started

> "Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves." â€“ Tim Berners-Lee

Data is often the lifeblood of applications.
And, often that data can be broken down into collections of objects, or entities.

The NgRx Entity library provides:

* An entity adapter for storing collections of data.
* Collection methods to create, read, update and delete entities in state.
* Selectors to access the entities dictionary, the ordered array of entities, the array of unique identifiers for the entities and the total count of entities in the collection.

## Installation

Install the @ngrx/entity module:

```bash
npm install @ngrx/entity -P
yarn add @ngrx/entity
```
