# Create a Store

Our first task is to create a store in our simple-store project.
All commands assume your current directory is the **course** directory.

To get started, create a new **store** directory and create the following files:

* actions.ts
* model.ts
* reducers.ts
* store.ts

```bash
mkdir projects/simple-store/src/app/store
touch projects/simple-store/src/app/store/actions.ts
touch projects/simple-store/src/app/store/models.ts
touch projects/simple-store/src/app/store/reducers.ts
touch projects/simple-store/src/app/store/store.ts
```

Open the **store.ts** file.

## Interfaces

First, create the `Action` interface. 
Each action will be a class that implements this interface, which simply requires the `type` string property.

```javascript
export interface Action {
  type: string;
}
```

Next, create a `ReducerMap` interface.
This interface will be used to define the reducer functions associated with each property in the state object.

```javascript
export interface ReducerMap {
  \[key: string]: Function;
}
```

*Note*: Disregard the leading backslash. This is to work around an issue with Gitbook.

Finally, create the `State` interface.
This interface represents the state object.

```javascript
export interface State {
  \[key: string]: any;
}
```

*Note*: Disregard the leading backslash. This is to work around an issue with Gitbook.

## `Store` Class

Create a new `Store` class:

```javascript
export class Store {
  private state$ = new BehaviorSubject<State>(null);

  constructor(public reducers: ReducerMap, private state: State = {}) {}

  dispatch(action: Action) {
    this.notify(action);
    this.state$.next(this.state);
  }

  notify(action: Action) {
    Object.keys(this.reducers).forEach(key => {
      this.state[key] = this.reducers[key](this.state[key], action);
    });
  }

  subscribe(
    next: (value: State) => void,
    error?: (error: any) => void,
    complete?: () => void
  ) {
    return this.state$.subscribe(next, error, complete);
  }
}
```

* The `state$` property is a new `Subject` that subscribers can subscribe to.
* The `constructor()` function requires a `reducers` object along with an optional `state` object, which defaults to an empty `Object`.
* The `dispatch()` method accepts an `action` and then invokes the `notify` method and emits a next notification to the `state$` subject using the `next()` method.
* The `notify()` method accepts an `action` and then invokes the `reducer()` function for each slice of state, updating the `state` object.
* The `subscribe()` method requires a `next` argument, which is a function that accepts the `State` and returns void. The `error` and `complete` arguments are optional. The method returns a new `Subscription` to the `state$` subject.
